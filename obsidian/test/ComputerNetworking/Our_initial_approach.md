First thing that we are going to do is modify the inbound rules on the testbed-ultimate
    - Protocol Type:UDP 
    - using port 1194
    - 

Next we are going to setup the subnet for all the computers that are in my office.
    - That way every device does not need to have the OpenVPN client setup. 

Then we need to refine our inbound and outbound rules and do some pen testing

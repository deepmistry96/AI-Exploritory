So we were messsing around with getting the connection through the VPN VPC and we started messing around with the Incomming Connections checkbox

Rob kept coming back to the fact that we are connecting to the VPN so we should not have any issues with the Public part of the firewall because all traffic was being routed though a private connection.

This made us start to question the terms Public and Private. 
    - The Public Firewall on Windows is not really talking about network topology. It is more of a configuration, the Windows does not work

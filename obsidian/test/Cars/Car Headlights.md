The brightness of headlights on new cars has been a topic of discussion and concern for some drivers. Here are a few points to consider:

1. **Technological Advancements**: Newer cars often come equipped with LED or HID (High-Intensity Discharge) headlights. These lights are brighter and more energy-efficient than traditional halogen bulbs. While this provides better visibility for the driver, it can sometimes be perceived as too bright or blinding by oncoming traffic or drivers in front of the vehicle.
    
2. **Regulations and Standards**: In many countries, there are regulations governing the brightness and alignment of vehicle headlights. These standards are designed to ensure that headlights are effective for the driver without causing undue glare or safety issues for other road users. However, these regulations may vary by region, and some argue that they haven't kept pace with the advancements in headlight technology.
    
3. **Proper Adjustment**: A significant factor in the perceived brightness of headlights is their alignment. If headlights are not properly adjusted, they can shine directly into the eyes of other drivers, which can be dazzling or blinding. This issue can be exacerbated by the higher placement of headlights in SUVs and trucks compared to sedans.
    
4. **Subjective Perceptions**: Sensitivity to light varies among individuals. Some drivers may find newer headlights excessively bright, particularly older drivers or those with certain eye conditions.
    
5. **Safety Considerations**: Brighter headlights can enhance safety by improving visibility at night or in poor weather conditions. However, if they cause discomfort or visibility issues for other drivers, this can potentially create safety risks.
    

In summary, while the increased brightness of headlights in new cars can improve visibility for the driver, it can also lead to discomfort or safety concerns for other road users. The balance between ensuring adequate visibility and preventing glare is a continuing challenge in vehicle design and regulation.

Dealing with the issue of overly bright headlights from other vehicles can be challenging, but there are several steps you can take to mitigate the effects:

1. **Adjust Your Rearview Mirror**: Most cars have a tab on the bottom of the rearview mirror that allows you to switch to a "night" setting. This tilts the mirror slightly, reducing the glare from headlights behind you while still allowing you to see vehicles in the reflection.
    
2. **Use Your Sun Visors**: The sun visors in your car can be adjusted to block out bright lights from certain angles, both from the front and the sides.
    
3. **Properly Align Your Own Headlights**: Ensure your vehicle's headlights are properly aligned. Misaligned headlights can contribute to the problem by blinding other drivers, who may then fail to dim their own bright lights.
    
4. **Wear Anti-Glare Glasses**: If you're particularly sensitive to bright lights at night, consider wearing glasses with anti-glare lenses while driving.
    
5. **Keep Your Windshield Clean**: A dirty windshield can scatter light and make glare worse. Keeping it clean both inside and out can help reduce this effect.
    
6. **Regular Eye Check-Ups**: Regular check-ups with an optometrist are important, especially if you find yourself struggling with night vision or glare more than usual.
    
7. **Avoid Staring Directly at Oncoming Lights**: Focus on the right side of your lane and use the painted road markings or the lane's edge as a guide, rather than looking directly at oncoming headlights.
    
8. **Report Excessively Bright Headlights**: If you notice a particular vehicle with excessively bright or misaligned headlights, you might consider reporting it to the relevant authorities as it could be a safety hazard.
    
9. **Advocate for Better Regulations**: You can also get involved in advocacy for better regulations regarding headlight brightness and alignment standards.
    

Remember, while these steps can help, they won't eliminate the issue entirely. Adjusting how you react to bright headlights, however, can make night driving a bit safer and more comfortable.
